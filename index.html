                  I have been a Bandcamp fan since 2010 as it has helped me find an array of fresh, eclectic, and approachable artists that I still listen to today. BadBadNotGood, Mouse On The Keys, Jeff Pianki - The list goes on!

                  As a user, I have happily grown with the changes and improvements that have been made over time to help discover new artists.

                  From the artist's perspective, using Bandcamp has been a pleasure from day one. It has always been designed and functioned beautifully. Stellar product.

                    In my previous role, I answered 75+ phone calls a day in addition to correspondences crafted specifically and personally via email and fax. Everything from checking a price to investigating missing shipments on behalf of a  customer. I also oversaw the front desk, performing transactions for deliveries and pick-up orders. This helped solidify my ability to multi-task, prioritize, and ultimately make effective decisions rapidly. If being a problem solver was cool, you could consider me Miles Davis.

                    Before that I sold cell phone service in person to consumers and businesses. Making sure to do right by both my customers and my company was an everlasting challenge that I enjoyed accomplishing.

                  <p>I'm confident that my work would live up to what Bandcamp and it's users expect based off of my experience and my own expectations of Bandcamp.</p>

      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Steve Smith. I am a great candidate as your new support person. I built this small website in regards to the support role opportunity. I use, understand, and absolutely love Bandcamp so I am <span class="thrilled">thrilled</span> to have seen this opportunity arise.

        In addition to my senior level experience in customer support, I am also a full stack web developer capable of assisting both customers and team members alike. I care deeply about communication, and truly live for those exciting moments of a new musical discovery.
