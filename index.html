                  I have been a Bandcamp fan since 2010 as it has helped me find new approachable artists that I still listen to today. BadBadNotGood, Mouse On The Keys, Jeff Pianki - The list goes on! As a user, I have happily grown with the changes and improvements that have been made over time.

      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Steve Smith and I built this small website in regards to the support role opportunity at Bandcamp. I use, understand, and absolutely love Bandcamp so I am <span class="thrilled">thrilled</span> to have seen this opportunity arise.
      </p> 
      <p>
        In addition to my senior level experience in customer support, I am also a full stack web developer capable of assisting both customers and team members alike. I care deeply about communication, and I live for those exciting moments of a new musical discovery for not only myself but for everyone around me. Because Bandcamp has brought me to so many of those moments, I would love to be a contributing part of it.
